## Main ideas

- Understand statistical process terminology

- Understand the types of conclusions that can be made given the underlying
  statistical process
  
# Polls and statistical terminology

Go to the Monmouth University Polling Institute 
[website](https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/) and select a 
poll of interest. Briefly read the poll results and methodology section at the
end. Try and identify the following:

- Population of interest:

- Parameter of interest:

- Sample:

- Sample size:

- Sample statistic:

- Sample statistic's value:

# Confounding variables

A group of researchers decide to study the causes of heart disease by carrying 
out an observational study. The researchers find that the people in their 
study who ate lots of red meat also developed heart disease. They believe they 
have found a link (or ‘correlation’) between eating red meat and developing 
heart disease, and they (or those reading their research) might be tempted to 
conclude that eating lots of red meat is a cause of heart disease. However, 
before making a conclusion like this, the researchers must think about 
confounding factors (variables).

List three confounding factors that could be at play here.

Given that the above study was observational, what type of conclusion can be
made?
